    <p style=color:white;> Park Shops was one of the first buildings constructed on the campus of North Carolina State University as an industrial shop for steel fabrication courses. This 1914 three-story, masonry structure is an L-shaped building which forms two sides of a new campus plaza and has now been transformed into a 21st century multi-functional campus building. In order to accommodate the demands of the modern lecture halls, laboratories, and student advising offices, and to help the building address the new landscape plaza located in the former loading area, the interior layout was completely re-oriented.Park Shops was one of the first buildings </p>

First, the existing masonry walls and wood ceilings that had completely been covered by drywall and paint were sandblasted to reintroduce the natural qualities of the historic materials. The demolition process was also used to create unique public spaces by removing floor plates in certain locations. At the main public stair, an opening was cut into the floor to allow for the space to have views of the entire three-story structure and to bring daylight deep into the building.
