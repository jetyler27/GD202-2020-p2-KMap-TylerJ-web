        <h5> Initial Thoughts </h5>
     <p> Through observations and interviews, I have found that students at NC State enjoy going to the Park Shops location on North Campus to do work and study. From the three people I interviewed, all of their answers related to similar elements of the space. <b>They enjoyed the high ceilings and natural light </b> the large windows allowed in. Their answers led me to wonder if beyond providing comfort, those factors had an affect on how they completed work and studied. </p>

<p> 
    Meyers-Levy and Zhu studies showed that ceiling height influences psychological well being, promotes clearer and improved thinking, and can provoke an increase in energy. Even the illusion of higher ceilings can invoke these effects. This first article I read did not have a solid theory that explains why high ceilings have this effect, but sought out to find evidence to back up their findings. At first I was weary after reading this because I thought that the authors were providing information that they could not provide support for, but I continued to read.
      </p>
 
<p>
    Before diving into their experiment, Meyers-Levy and Zhu provide a joint prediction as to why certain ceilings have the effect that they do. They propose that “different types of concepts might be activated or primed by the showroom ceiling if it were relatively high, as it tends to be in most contemporary mall stores, versus low, as it is in most strip mall shops and outlet centers. Relatively high ceilings may prime thoughts related to freedom, whereas lower ceilings may prompt those that pertain to confinement” . The key word  is ‘prime’, high ceilings do not necessarily alter your thoughts but can influence your mindset for a certain period of time. Applying this insight to the parameters of Park Shops, the high ceilings would provide a sense of mental freedom to students doing work there. Since Park Shops also houses lecture halls, this could have an impact grades.

         <h5> The Experiment</h5> 
      
    
<p>
In their article they conducted three different experiments to study the variable of different ceiling heights and what effect they had on information processing. The first consisted of borrowing a method used by Aarts and Dijksterhuis , where they developed two tasks. The first assessed whether high versus low ceiling height can activate such freedom related thought versus confinement related concepts and thereby influence individuals current perceived body state. The second task was to solve anagrams in three different conditions. They devised it in a way that the words that could be arranged were related to the concept of freedom (which I do not see why it was relevant), confinement, or unrelated to either. I was confused with the correlation between physical freedom and its connection to an anagram but the idea was not expanded on.

        <h5> The Stats </h5>
    <div>
    <p>
The impact of light on humans has been studied since the 1920s. One study was conducted by Tennesen and Cimprick, mentioned in Shishegar and Boubekri’s article on silk weavers. It was found that <b>people with views of natural vegetation had better attention during work hours because it exposed them to daylight.</b> It was also shown that it improved drowsiness after lunch and increased alertness. This would be beneficial to students in Park Shops as it is a popular spot on campus to get food and study. Another study Shishegar and Boubekri provide in their article is one conducted in the 1990s. Employees of the West Bend Mutual Insurance Company moved into a new building where the number of employees who had a workstation with a window view <b>increased from 30% to 96%.</b> Compared to the old building, productivity increased by 16% and was measured by the amount of claims processed.

These studies mentioned by Mott et al.  and Shishegar and Boubekri both provide the importance and impact of light in a historical and modern setting. It was fitting to analyze both natural light and artificial light to furthermore emphasize the evolution that has taken and continues to take over time. Seeing how humans have evolved and adapted with and around light made me realize that something so mundane has such significance. 

Through the studies conducted throughout the last century, it has been demonstrated that light does influence people. Sunlight specifically plays the largest role in productivity because of its qualities. I appreciate the liberal use of different studies that Shishegar and Boubekri provide in their article because it improves their credibility and also drives their initial statement home. It also gives me a broad range of support to rationalize light being a factor in increasing productivity and improving the studying experience.
